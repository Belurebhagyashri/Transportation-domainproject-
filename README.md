# Transportation-domain Project-
 Utilizing cloud-based data hosted on MacLeod servers.
 I analyzed large-scale trip and delivery data, integrated from EFS fuel and maintenance payment systems. 
 Using Power BI, I developed interactive dashboards highlighting key KPIs like revenue per mile, on-time deliveries, and geo-distribution of trips.
 I also created DAX-driven reports for advanced insights such as cost analysis, delivery performance, and trendÂ forecasting.
